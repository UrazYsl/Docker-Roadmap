__Bare_Metal__
-When applications are run directly on hardware
-Maximum performance
-Minimum flexibility

__VM__
-Uses Hypervisors to run multiple OSs
-Strong isolation
-Higher overhead(extra cost in resources)

__Containers__
-Shared host OS kernel
-Lightweight isolation
-Better resource efficiency than VM
-Better portability than Bare Metal


ADDITIONALLY:
__OCI(Open Container Initiative)__
-Project that aims to set industry standarts for container formats & runtimes
-Basically ensure compatability and interopability of containers
-Prevention of "Docker" to lock-in containers
